# datingapp

The project involved developing an innovative dating application designed to facilitate meaningful connections between users. The application allows users to find matches based on their preferences and engage in real-time conversations. A key feature of the system is the match-based messaging functionality, which ensures that users can only interact with profiles they have matched with, thereby enhancing user privacy and providing a personalized experience. The project aimed to deliver a seamless, intuitive user experience by integrating real-time communication features and a user-friendly interface, creating a robust platform for users to connect and interact.
